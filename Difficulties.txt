Right logic for scrolling into a page section by clicking on a button.

Aligning every item in the right way because flexbox is kinda new for me.

Page wouldnt change to the resume one when the button was clicked.

Flex Education Container.

Implement Frame motion framework since it's new.

Implementing the Slider since I've never done it before and it wasnt properly sliding the text from right to left.
